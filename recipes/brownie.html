    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A co-worker couldn't decide on her favorite for her birthday treat, brownies or chocolate chip cookies, so she said I should just pick one. On the way home I thought this up and couldn't find it on Allrecipes so I created it. These go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for cookie layer</h3>
    <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <h3>Ingredients for brownie layer</h3>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Beat softened butter, light brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl until creamy. Add 1 egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish to cover completely.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 cup white sugar, melted butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl; add 2 eggs and beat well. Mix cocoa powder into butter mixture until well-combined. Stir 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt into cocoa mixture until batter is combined. Pour brownie batter over cookie dough and spread to cover completely.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brookies comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>
