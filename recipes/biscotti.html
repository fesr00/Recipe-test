    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fresh tasting biscotti with orange zest, dried cranberries, white chocolate, and pistachios. Very light and tasty.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 egg white</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup dried cranberries</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups pistachio nuts</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar, orange zest, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs and egg white one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually blend into the creamed mixture using a wooden spoon. Stir in the white chocolate, dried cranberries, and pistachios. Cover, and chill for 30 minutes, or until dough is no longer sticky.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and divide into halves. Form each half into a flattish log about 12 inches long by 3 inches wide. Arrange logs at least 3 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes in preheated oven, or until pale gold. Allow logs to cool on the baking sheet until cool enough to handle. On a cutting board, cut logs crosswise on a diagonal into 1 inch thick slices. Arrange on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden. Transfer biscotti to wire racks, and cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
